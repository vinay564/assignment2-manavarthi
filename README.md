## Vinay Manavarthi
### My favorite place is my village which is Jaddangi <br>

My village is a place that I like to visit in my holidays or whenever I feel tired and want to relax. A village is a place that is far away from the __pollution__ and __noise__ of the city. Also, you feel a connection with the soil in a village. Moreover, there are trees, a variety of crops, diversity of flowers, and rivers, etc. Besides all this, you feel the cold breeze at night and a warm but pleasant breeze in the day.
